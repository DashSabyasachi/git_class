one by one all command practice:
..................................
git init(initialize a git repo)
git add .
git commit -m "version name"
git branch -m main
git remote origin repo_link
git push -u origin main
Then for another branch as sabya
git branch -m sabya (sabya branch created)
git status
git add fileA.py
git commit -m "push1 from sabya"
git push -u origin sabya(fileA.py pushed from sabya branch)
now i will merge the sabya branch with mainbranch
git checkout main (only branch change done)
git pull origin main
git merge sabya 
git push origin main

git merge: Git merge is a Git operation that combines changes from one branch into another by creating a new merge commit, preserving the complete history of both branches.


for cloning:         git clone repo_path(ssh/https)
for pull a clone folder:       git pull origin main



process of remove merge conflict:  1st conflict happen on that time when we commited same file from 2 or more branches at the same time then git was unable to know which change it will keep or which not. so merge conflict happen.
then if we got to konow from which file conflict happen and then locally we visit this file remove <<<<<  ====   >>>>> symbols and save it again.
then execute in CLI some commands
git add .
git commit -m "version_name"
git push origin branch_name




git cherry-pick:  this command is used for move a specific file from one branch to another through gitCommitHash. 
git cherry-pick commitHash
git push origin main



git log : used for see the commit history for any branch.
git log main
git log sabya
git log main --oneline
git log --oneline --graph



git diff: used for see the difference between the branch, commit(by commitHash) but if there is no difference it will not show anything.
git diff main sabya
git diff 60w4586 78q5241


git rebase: Git rebase is used to integrate changes from one branch into another by replaying commits on top of the latest base branch, instead of creating a merge commit. we only do rebasing for feature branch not shared branch. git rebase update file based on commit history.

git checkout featureBranch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push origin featureBranch --force-with-lease


git stash: it is just like a temporary savepoint. it saves uncommited changes and clean the working tree without committing.
git stash   ---->temporarily save the changes
git stash pop   ----->apply and remove the stash
git stash apply stash@{0} ---> apply stash from selected stash name
git restore filename.txt --->undo the change and restore the last commited version.


 

git status
git add tax.txt
git commit -m "version name"
git branch -m main
git remote origin repolink
git push -u origin main

git pull origin main
git merge jeet
git push origin main

git clone link

git cherry-pick gitHash
git push origin main

git log
git log --oneline

git diff

git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push origin featureBranch
